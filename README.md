This is Week 3 of Makers

# intro_to_the_web

we installed two gems: sinatra, and shotgun.  
Shotgun allows us to automatically reload the webpage so that we can see the changes in the code we edit as we go.  
So instead of running 'ruby app.rb' on the terminal, we run 'shotgun app.rb -p 4567', where the -p switch tells shotgun which port to use; in our browser we load 'localhost:4567'.
